## 🏗️ **New Asynchronous Architecture**

This application now uses a **robust asynchronous polling architecture** to handle long-running AI operations without timeout issues:

### **Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ **No Timeouts**: Background functions can run indefinitely
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Live progress indicators every 5 seconds  
- ✅ **Better UX**: Immediate feedback and smooth interactions
- ✅ **Scalable**: Multiple users can run analyses concurrently
- ✅ **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### **How It Works:**
1. **User Input** → Fast job creation (< 1 second)
2. **Background Processing** → AI analysis without time limits
3. **Real-time Polling** → Status updates every 5 seconds
4. **Result Delivery** → Seamless workflow display
